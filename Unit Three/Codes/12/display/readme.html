        display: property in CSS is used to control how an element is rendered in the web browser. It determines the type of box or layout model used for an element, which affects how it behaves and interacts with other elements on the page.

        The display property accepts various values, each serving a specific purpose. 
        
        Some commonly used examples values are:
        -> block: The element is formatted as a block-level element. It typically starts on a new line and takes up the full available width. Block-level elements allow you to set width, height, margins, padding, and other box-model properties. Examples of block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, and <section>.

        -> inline: The element is formatted as an inline-level element. It does not start on a new line and only occupies as much horizontal space as necessary. Inline elements do not support setting width and height properties but allow applying padding, margins, and text-related properties. Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, and <em>.

        -> inline-block: The element is displayed inline but behaves like a block-level element. It flows within the text and allows setting width, height, margins, padding, and other box-model properties. Inline-block elements can have multiple elements on the same line. This value combines characteristics of both inline and block display types.

        -> none: The element is completely removed from the document flow and not rendered. It effectively hides the element, and its space collapses. Other elements on the page will behave as if the element does not exist. This value is commonly used for dynamically showing or hiding elements using JavaScript.

        -> flex: The element becomes a flex container, enabling you to use the flexible box layout, also known as flexbox. Flexbox provides powerful capabilities for creating flexible and responsive layouts. It allows you to control the alignment, ordering, and sizing of flex items within the container.
