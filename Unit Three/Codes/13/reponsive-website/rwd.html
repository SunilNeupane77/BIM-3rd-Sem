        <h1>Rock Legend Robin Tamang No More ðŸ˜”</h1>
        <article>
            <p>
                Legendary rockstar Robin Tamang is no more.
                Known for his immense impact on the Rock Nâ€™ Roll scene, Robin Tamang is a household name in the
                Nepali
                music industry. With hits like â€˜Swatantra Jiwanâ€™, â€˜Keta Ketiâ€™, â€˜Dam Maro Damâ€™, â€˜Timro Dinâ€™ and
                â€˜Ektaâ€™
                among others, Tamang is remembered by fans for his infectious energy on stage and his soulful voice.
                His
                sudden departure at the age of 60 has left a profound void in the Nepali music scene and in the
                lives of
                those who knew and admired him.
            </p>

            <p>
                60-year-old Tamang passed away on Tuesday morning at his Budhanilkantha residence, according to his
                family. His sister, Bhagwati Tamang, reported his death to the police around 6 pm.
            </p>

            <p>
                Born in Singapore in the summer of 1963, Tamang was the youngest of five siblings. He began his
                musical
                career after moving to Nepal in 1996. After teaming up with the band Looza, Tamang released his
                first
                album, â€˜Nepalâ€™ (as Robin Nâ€™ Looza), in 1998.

            <p>
                Although he was known for his vivacious rockstar persona on stage, his friends and fellow musicians
                call
                him a humble, cheerful man with a big heart.
