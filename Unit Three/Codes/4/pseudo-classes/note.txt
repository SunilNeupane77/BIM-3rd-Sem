A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

    -> Style an element when a user mouses over it
    -> Style visited and unvisited links differently
    -> Style an element when it gets focus
    -> Pseudo-classes are keywords that start with a colon. Such as ":hover" is a pseudo-class.


Definition: 
A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. they are the first element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer. They tend to act as if you had applied a class to some part of your document, often helping you cut down on excess classes in your markup, and giving you more flexible, maintainable code.
