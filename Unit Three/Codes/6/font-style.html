        London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November
        weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth, and it
        would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up
        Holborn Hill.
