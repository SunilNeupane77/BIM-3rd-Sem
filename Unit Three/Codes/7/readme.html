        Note: Default font size in a browser is 16px
              1em = 16px
              1em = 11/64 inch
              1em = 100%

        Absolute Units:
        -> The absolute units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these  will 
           appear as exactly size.

           Units:
           a. cm (centimeters)
           b. mm (milimeters)
           c. in (inches - 1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
           d. px (pixels - 1px = 1/96th of 1in)
           e. pt (points - 1pt = 1/72nd of 1in)
           f. pc (picas 1pc = 12pt)

        Relative Units:
        -> The relative units specify a length relative to another length property.
        -> Relative lenghts units scale better between different rendering medium.

           Units:
           a. em (relative to current font size of the element i.e. 2em means
                  2 times the size of the current font.)

           b. ex (relative to the lowercase 'x' height of the current font.)

           c. ch (relative to the width of the '0' i.e. zero)

           d. rem (relative to the font size of the root element i.e. html)

           e. vw (relative to the 1% of the width of the entire screen or viewport); 
                 Hint: viewport refers to the browser window size.
           
           f. vh (relative to the 1% of the height of the entire screen or viewport)

           g. % (relative to its parent element.)
