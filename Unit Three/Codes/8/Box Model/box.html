  <h1>Thinking Inside the Box</h1>
  <p class=”description”>
    When you are styling a web page with CSS you
    must start to think in terms of <b>boxes</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each element is treated as if it generates a new box. Each box can have
    new rules associated with it.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you can see from the diagram above, each box has a <b>border</b>.
    Between the content and the border you can have <b>padding</b>, and
    outside of the border you can have a <b>margin</b> to separate this box
    from any neighboring boxes.
