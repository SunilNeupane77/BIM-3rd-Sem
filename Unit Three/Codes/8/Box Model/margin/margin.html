<body>
    <p>
        This paragraph will contain some <em>keywords</em> which will have added shading and a larger <em>margin</em>
        around them.
        You will see that the <em>left</em> and <em>right</em> of these elements are spread wider than other words.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each <em>keyword</em> also has a <em>background-color</em> property set to illustrate where the edge of the
        element is and enhance
        the affect of the <em>margin</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Between each <em>paragraph</em> there is also a top and bottom margin, although only the top one will show
        between paragraphs because of the
        smaller vertical margin <em>collapsing</em> into the larger one.
    </p>
