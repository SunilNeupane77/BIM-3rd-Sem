    Weapons not food, not homes, not shoes Not need, just feed the war cannibal animal
    I walk tha corner to tha rubble that used to be a library Line up to tha mind cemetery now
    What we don't know keeps tha contracts alive an movin' They don't gotta burn tha books they just remove 'em
    While arms warehouses fill as quick as tha cells Rally round tha family, pockets full of shells

    Rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells
    They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells
    They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells
    They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells
