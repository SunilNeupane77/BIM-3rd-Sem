    <!-- 
    
    box-sizing: is a property that determines how 
    the overall dimensions of the element (including
    content, padding, border and margin) are calculated. 

    This property takes two values:
    a. content-box (default)
       -> do not includes border, padding and content size for width and height. 
       
       b. border-box
       -> includes border, padding and content size for width and height. 
    

    Q. So which one to use content-box or border-box?

    Ans: In almost all cases border-box is easier to 
    work with. For example, if you set a width to 100%,
    using border-box does not cause the element to 
    overflow it's parent when there is padding or margin.
