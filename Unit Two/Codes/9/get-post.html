        Method Attribute:
        It specifices how to send the form data to a webserver. The data can be sent as URL 
        variable, by using the HTTP get or as HTTP post method. 
        
        -> GET (default)
        -> POST

        A. GET:
            -> sends form data as part of the URL.
            -> Appends form data into the URL in name/value pairs.
            -> The length of a URL is limited to 2048 characters.
            -> Never use GET method if you have password or other sensitive 
               information to be sent on the server.
            -> Useful for form submission where user want to bookmark the result
             (i.e. GET method can be bookmarked).
            -> Get is better for non-secure data like, query strings in google.
            -> Get cannot be used to send binary data. E.g., images or documents.

        B. POST:
            -> hides form data as a part of the URL.
            -> Appends form data inside the body of the HTTP request (data is not 
               shown in URL.)
            -> The POST method doesnot have any restriction on data size to be sent.
            -> Form submission with POST cannot be bookmarked.
            -> The POST method can be used to send ASCII as well as binary data. 
               E.g., image, word documents, etc.
            -> The data sent by POST method goes through HTTP header so security 
               depends on HTTP protocol. By using secure HTTP (or HTTPs) you can make 
               sure that your information is secured.
            -> POST is little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored 
               in browser history or in web server logs.

        Q. Why get method can be bookmarked and post method cannot be bookmarked?
        
        Ans: An HTTP POST can be bookmarked, but since a bookmark only consists of 
        the URL, all of the form parameters will be lost. This will often mean that 
        the web server doesn't know what to do with the request, since it was 
        expecting some form parameters.

        If you submit a form via a GET request, all of the form parameters go into 
        the URL (after the ?), so a bookmark will contain all of the information 
        needed for the webserver to rebuild the page a second time.

        Hence, get method can be bookmarked and post method cannot be bookmarked.
